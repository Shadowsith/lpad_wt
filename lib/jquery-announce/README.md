# jQuery.announce - A micro-plugin for displaying unobtrusive announcements.

## Overview:

This plugin provides a minimal, lightweight, and customizable notification API for showing unobtrusive announcements in various styles. It's flexible enough to mold to your application's existing stylesheet and markup.

Features:

- Simple syntax:
  - `$.announce.info('Hello there!')`
  - `$.announce.danger('Delete this?')`
  - `$.announce.success('All done?')`
  - `$.announce.warning('Are you sure?')`
- Minimal default styles; easy to customize or write your own.
- Show/hide hooks for adding custom animation (works well with Velocity.js).
- Responsive
- Works well with Bootstrap and other frameworks
- Compact! (about 110 lines)

## Demo

A quick demo can be found on CodePen: http://codepen.io/claviska/pen/EZrrZz

A local demo can be found in `example.html`.

## Installing

Include the minified version of this plugin in your project or install via NPM:

```
npm install --save @claviska/jquery-announce
```

## Using the plugin

```javascript
// Minimal example
$.announce.info('Hi there!');

// Example with options
$.announce.info({
  message: 'Well <em>hello</em> there!',
  duration: 2000,
  hideOnClick: true,
  html: true
});
```

### Methods

The following announcements are included by default:

- `$.announce.info(options)`
- `$.announce.danger(options)`
- `$.announce.success(options)`
- `$.announce.warning(options)`

There is also a method to create custom announcements:

- `$.announce.say('your-custom-type', options)`

In this case, the resulting announcement will be assigned the following classes that you can use for styling purposes: `announce announce-your-custom-type`

**Note:** By design, only one announcement will ever be shown at a time. Multiple notifications (i.e. stacking or growl-style) are outside the scope of this micro-plugin.

### Options

If `options` is a string, it will be used as the message. If options is an object, it will be merged with `$.announce.defaults`.

Available options:

- `className`: The class name to assign to the announcement.
- `duration`: The length of time in milliseconds to show the announcement.
- `hideOnClick`: If true, the announcement will be hidden when the user clicks on it.
- `html`: If true, HTML will not be escaped when setting the message.
- `show`: Function for showing the announcement. Use `this` to reference the announcement element. Must return a promise-compatible object that resolves when the promise is completely visible. (This promise is currently not used, but is included for future enhancements.) Default value:
  ```javascript
  function() {
    var defer = $.Deferred();
    $(this).fadeIn(250, function() {
      defer.resolve();
    });
    return defer;
  }
  ```
- `hide`: Function for hiding the announcement. Use `this` to reference the announcement element. Must return a promise-compatible object that resolves when the announcement is completely hidden. Default value:
  ```javascript
  function() {
    var defer = $.Deferred();
    $(this).fadeOut(250, function() {
      $(this).remove();
      defer.resolve();
    });
    return defer;
  }
  ```

You may also update the default options *before calling either method*:

```javascript
$.announce.defaults.optionName = yourValue;
```

### Promises

All announcements return a promise-compatible ([jQuery-deferred](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.deferred/)) object that will resolve once the announcement is completely hidden:

```javascript
$.announce.info('Hi there!').then(function() {
  console.log('Dismissed!');
});
```
